# Authentication & Users Module
This module handles the secure lifecycle of user accounts. It includes user registration and login, password hashing using bcrypt, and a robust system for session management. In the future, this module will be enhanced with JWT or OAuth2 tokens to support secure, open APIs for third-party integrations, ensuring a seamless and safe user experience.
